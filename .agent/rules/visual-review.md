# Visual Review Mandate

When making any design, wireframe, or UI changes, you MUST:

1.  **Visual Verification**: NEVER rely solely on code-based review.
2.  **Browser Inspection**: Use the browser tool to render the page and view the actual output.
3.  **Grade Against Intent**: Compare the rendered result against the intended design/requirements to ensure accuracy.
4.  **Iterate**: Self-correct any visual discrepancies before requesting user review.
